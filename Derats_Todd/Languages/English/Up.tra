@51= ~Hey ... I see you're wearing Goldbrand, the katana that was blessed by an outside god. How do I know ? Doesn't matter ; what matters is I know the secret that unfolds the true power of this weapon.~
@52= ~If you bring me the heart of a vampire, I'll be able to awaken the blade. To achieve this, I only ask you a mere 11.171 gold pieces. It's not much for adventurers like you, but believe me, this is the necessary amount.~
@53= ~Ha ! I can see you have the vampire's heart and the required gold pieces. So, shall I awaken your blade ?~
@54= ~Alright, I'll think about it. Goodbye.~
