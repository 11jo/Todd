Technological items (the last in the store) have two advantages:
- Armors can be worn in conjunction with other AC-enhancing magic items.
- The Charged Ring can be worn by a wizard slayer
They also have two disadvantages:
- Weapons cannot affect creatures that can only be affected by magical weapons.
- All items (with the exception of grenades) create a "negative luck" effect if worn by a spellcaster. The degree of negative luck depends on the user's magic power, as shown in the table below:

	Classe				  Negative luck
	Paladin						-1
	Ranger						-1
	Warrior / Mage / Thief		-1
	Barde						-2
	Warrior / Mage				-2
	Warrior / Cleric			-2
	Warrior / Druid				-2
	Mage / Thief				-2
	Cleric / Thief				-2
	Cleric / Ranger				-3
	Warrior / Mage / Cleric		-3
	Mage						-4
	Sorcier						-4
	Cleric						-4
	Druid						-4
	Mage / Cleric				-6



Grenades are technological, and in fact their effect is not stopped by magic resistance.
Grenades should apply the "negative luck" effect to spellcasters and have a chance of exploding in their hands, but I couldn't find a way to script that, so I replaced it with "grenades unusable by spellcasters".

Arcanum has firearms. Unfortunately, I haven't found a way to recreate these weapons in BG2(EE). Edit: finally I found a way, but in which weapon skill should they be placed? And which icons?
